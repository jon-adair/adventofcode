# Advent of Code

Have had kind of a bad history doing Advent of Code

I started it in 2020 using Go and made it through Day 20 part A but bogged down in part B. The next day we had a sudden COVID death in our family and things kind of fell apart. 

I made it through day 14 in 2021 but travel and getting sick brought me to a halt.

I don't even remember what stopped me in 2022 but I dropped it after the first week.

It's a little challenging here since the puzzles drop at midnight Eastern so I'm either doing them quickly at what's already well past my usual bedtime or I'm doing them when I first wake up.

I mostly do very little cleanup after solving before committing and am scrambling a bit to get the puzzle done so the code isn't as clean as I'd like.
