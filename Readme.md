# Advent of Code

I'm giving Advent of Code a try this year (2020). 

I thought about using it to challenge my Swift knowledge as I transition to it, but so far have been just using Go.

I mostly do very little cleanup after solving before committing and am scrambling a bit to get the puzzle done late at night before bed or early in the morning before work so the code isn't as clean as I'd like.
